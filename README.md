# K8-sgpt-tutorial
Learn &amp; Explore K8's GPT from scratch
Q :- Welcome to the K8sGPT Lab! In this lab, you'll explore how K8sGPT can help you analyze and troubleshoot Kubernetes clusters, focusing on a problematic NGINX deployment.

Prerequisites:

Access to a Kubernetes cluster
kubectl installed and configured
K8sGPT installed
Your own OpenAI API key (instructions on how to obtain one are provided by your instructor)
Q :- Step 3: Investigate the Service Issue

Run an analysis specifically targeting the Service in the k8sgpt namespace: k8sgpt analyze --explain --filter=Service --namespace k8sgpt
What problem does K8sGPT identify with the nginx-service? Store the error in /root/nginx-service-errors.txt.

Ans :- 1) To analyze the Service specifically in the k8sgpt namespace, run the command below:

controlplane ~ ➜  k8sgpt analyze --explain --filter=Service --namespace k8sgpt
 100% |██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| (1/1, 9908 it/s)

0: Service k8sgpt/nginx-service()
- Error: Service has not ready endpoints, pods: [Pod/nginx-deployment-6d5c8c75c4-4lqsq Pod/nginx-deployment-6d5c8c75c4-7tb6v Pod/nginx-deployment-6d5c8c75c4-5rp9k], expected 3
Error: Service has not ready endpoints, pods: [Pod/nginx-deployment-6d5c8c75c4-4lqsq Pod/nginx-deployment-6d5c8c75c4-7tb6v Pod/nginx-deployment-6d5c8c75c4-5rp9k], expected 3.
Solution: 1. Check the status of the pods using kubectl get pods. 2. Investigate why the pods are not ready (e.g. crash loops, resource constraints). 3. Fix the issues causing the pods to not be ready.
2) Copy the error message and store it in /root/nginx-service-errors.txt.

Error: Service has not ready endpoints, pods: [Pod/nginx-deployment-6d5c8c75c4-4lqsq Pod/nginx-deployment-6d5c8c75c4-7tb6v Pod/nginx-deployment-6d5c8c75c4-5rp9k], expected 3

Q :- Step 4: Examine Deployment Details

Analyze the Deployment resource specifically in the k8sgpt namespace: k8sgpt analyze --explain --filter=Deployment --namespace k8sgpt
What details does K8sGPT provide about the NGINX deployment issues?

Ans :- Command :- k8sgpt analyze --explain --filter=Deployment --namespace k8sgpt

Q :- Step 4: Examine Pod Details

Analyze the Pod resource specifically in the k8sgpt namespace: k8sgpt analyze --explain --filter=Pod --namespace k8sgpt
Are there any recommendations for fixing the Pods? Which of the following options is wrong?


Ans :-  Actual command :- k8sgpt analyze --explain --filter=Pod --namespace k8sgpt . Scale down the pods to zero and deleted the service .

Q :- Step 5: JSON Output for Automation

Perform an analysis of the resources in the k8sgpt namespace, output the results in JSON format, and save the output to /root/nginx.json.

Ans :- Run the command below to output the results in JSON format:

k8sgpt analyze --explain --namespace k8sgpt --output=json
To store the output in /root/nginx.json, use the redirection operator >.


Q :- Step 6: Anonymized Analysis

Run an analysis with anonymized results: k8sgpt analyze --explain --namespace k8sgpt --output=json --anonymize.
Compare this with the previous JSON output. What information has been anonymized?

Ans :- Actual command >:- k8sgpt analyze --explain --namespace k8sgpt --output=json --anonymize.

Q :- Step 6: Anonymized Analysis

Run an analysis with anonymized results: k8sgpt analyze --explain --namespace k8sgpt --output=json --anonymize.
In what scenarios might anonymized output be beneficial?

Ans :- 


Q :-Try to fix one of the identified issues (e.g., correct the Service port) and re-run the analysis. How does the output change?
Investigate how K8sGPT might help in identifying resource constraints. Are the current resource limits and requests appropriate?
Experiment with combining different flags and options to get more specific or comprehensive analysis results.

Ans :- 
To address the task of fixing an identified issue and re-running the analysis with K8sGPT, here's a step-by-step approach:

Fixing an Issue
Identify the Issue: Use K8sGPT to identify specific issues in your NGINX deployment, such as incorrect service ports or misconfigured resources.
Correct the Issue: For example, if the service port is incorrect, update the Kubernetes service configuration to reflect the correct port.
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: nginx-service
   spec:
     ports:
       - port: 80
         targetPort: 80
     selector:
       app: nginx

Apply the Changes: Use kubectl apply -f <your-config-file>.yaml to apply the changes.
Re-run the Analysis
Execute K8sGPT Again: Run K8sGPT to analyze the deployment after the fix. Observe any changes in the output, which should now reflect the resolved issue.
Investigating Resource Constraints
Resource Limits and Requests: Check if the current resource limits and requests are appropriate by analyzing the output from K8sGPT. It can highlight if there are any resource constraints affecting performance.
   resources:
     requests:
       memory: "64Mi"
       cpu: "250m"
     limits:
       memory: "128Mi"
       cpu: "500m"

Experimenting with Flags and Options
Use Different Flags: Experiment with K8sGPT's flags and options to get more specific or comprehensive analysis results. For example, you might use flags to focus on specific namespaces or types of resources.
By following these steps, you can effectively use K8sGPT to troubleshoot and optimize your Kubernetes deployments. This process not only helps in resolving current issues but also in understanding how to prevent similar problems in the future.


Q :- Reflect on how K8sGPT helped you identify and understand the issues in this NGINX deployment. Consider the following questions:

How does K8sGPT compare to manual troubleshooting methods?
What are the strengths and limitations of using K8sGPT for Kubernetes troubleshooting?
How might you integrate K8sGPT into your regular Kubernetes workflows or CI/CD pipelines?


Ans :- Reflecting on the use of K8sGPT for troubleshooting an NGINX deployment in Kubernetes, here are some insights:

Comparison with Manual Troubleshooting
Efficiency: K8sGPT can quickly analyze logs and configurations, providing insights much faster than manual methods.
Complexity: It simplifies the process by highlighting issues directly, whereas manual troubleshooting might require sifting through extensive logs and configurations.
Learning Curve: Manual methods can be more educational, helping you understand the underlying systems better.
Strengths of K8sGPT
Speed: Rapid identification of issues saves time, especially in large-scale environments.
Accuracy: Reduces human error by providing precise diagnostics.
User-Friendly: Offers a more accessible interface for those less familiar with Kubernetes intricacies.
Limitations of K8sGPT
Dependency: Over-reliance might lead to a lack of deep understanding of Kubernetes.
Scope: It might not cover all edge cases or complex scenarios that require human intuition.
Updates: Needs regular updates to stay effective with the latest Kubernetes features and issues.
Integration into Workflows or CI/CD Pipelines
Automated Checks: Integrate K8sGPT into CI/CD pipelines to automatically check deployments for issues before they go live.
Monitoring: Use it as part of a monitoring setup to continuously analyze the health of your Kubernetes clusters.
Training: Incorporate it into training sessions to help new team members learn about common issues and their resolutions.
By leveraging K8sGPT, you can enhance your Kubernetes management processes, making them more efficient and reliable. However, it's important to balance its use with manual methods to maintain a deep understanding of your systems.
